## About

My career started as an account manager apprenticeship and developed into a software engineer role. Personally, I value and treat others with an open-mindset. My approach is very engaging, value-driven, and methodical. I enjoy working in a high paced and autonomous environment that focuses on solutions.  

In 2020 I started to work as a volunteer teacher at [ReDI-school](https://www.redi-school.org/). ReDI School teaches technology to break down barriers and connect the digital leaders of tomorrow. Specifically, I am teaching Python introduction courses to young professionals. 

I enjoy sharing, collaborating and teaching, as well as contributing to the success of others - this is something I picked up while working for Microsoft. I enjoy public speaking and I value contributing and continuous-improvement, which is why I work on numerous inner source projects going on at Microsoft. My debut as a conference speaker was in 2019 at the [PowerShell conference EU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k33Nini-Dc8&list=PLAFABUrB0mNkbAhsdifsPK5XyBHnj_NSD&index=2&t=16s) where I introduced a test-driven development approach for Infrastructure as Code. Some of the stuff I present during community events can be found [here](/talks.html). 


### Founding of [MMMint.ai](https://mmmint.ai)
In 2020 two close friends and I founded [MMMint.ai](https://mmmint.ai). The goal is to bring data-driven solutions to small- and medium-sized businesses. My idea is to work closely with these companies to create products that can compete in an increasingly global and software-driven market. I hope that these efforts will teach me lessons that don't require size and available capital, unlike the lessons I learn working for Microsoft.

### Consulting [@Microsoft](https://microsoft.com)

At Microsoft, I was leading multiple large scale Big Data and Analytics Platform projects as a consultant. The goal of these projects was to enable customers in the financial services industry to rapidly develop and release scalable distributed big data applications.

These applications typically leveraged cloud-native, open-source solutions that are implemented on Microsoft's Cloud Azure. I was responsible for the whole software development lifecycle (SDLC), starting with the functional and technical analysis, design, implementation, test, deployment, release, and operations of different solutions areas, spanning application development, DevOps, security, as well as data engineering, and AI services.

During the time I was a speaker and a trainer evangelizing and advocating about the latest trends at Meetups, workshops, hackathons, and conferences. Frequent topics included: Cloud-Native, Infrastructure as Code, and DevOps. I was fortunate to be able to facilitate and host the [@PowerShell UserGroup in Munich](https://github.com/GPSUG).

I am an active maintainer and top contributor to numerous open- and inner-source projects, like the [DevOps Dojo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/devops-dojo-white-belt-foundation/). The Dojo started as an internal movement to make software development and implementation projects more efficient, which is now offered as a learning experience to customers outside of Microsoft.

During the time I was able to collect numerous certifications, that you can find on my [acclaim/mark-warneke](https://www.youracclaim.com/users/mark-warneke/badges).

### Developing [@Eve](https://starteve.ai)

At Eve I got the opportunity to work on an accessibility product that recognizes speech to generates automated live captions. Eve can augment humans, by proposing live captions that can be reviewed and corrected by humans for usage at conferences. The idea is to enable and make conferences more accessible by providing live captions and live translation. Users can read the captions on external monitors or even on their phone, using their preference for language, text size, and display setting.

Eve allowed me to develop further as a software engineer, always pushing for the most innovative and suitable solutions. We adopted cloud-native technologies like a micro-services architecture on Kubernetes, web-sockets, feature-flags, and continuous deployment. The product EVE allowed me to learn how to develop a product in a small team, to innovate, and to bring features to end-users as quickly as possible, while keeping the services available and resilient. 

### History

My career started as a Management Assistant at [ETe-Datentechnik](http://www.ete-datentechnik.com/) a small networking company from my hometown. I soon became the only account manager for the company at the age of just 18. My responsibility grew to be certified in the main technologies that we offered, including Cisco and IBM. My job was not only to consult and sell to exiting customer but to acquire new businesses by conducting cold-calls and driving marketing initiatives. My greatest success at that time was landing a multi-week server & storage project with IBM from a cold-call. After this experience, I moved on to university.

#### B.Sc. Business Informatics

During university [@the University of Applied Science Münster](https://en.fh-muenster.de), I fell in love with software development. I chose to specialize in Web & Software Engineering. As well as Business Intelligence, which included seminars on machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

At the time I was always looking to apply my knowledge and since the second semester, I started working as a working student for different companies, including [Vectron Systems](https://www.vectron-systems.com/) as a web developer. During my studies, I also took some smaller projects as a consultant for [KREAKTIV Münster e.V.](https://kreaktiv-muenster.de/), a student consultancy. I graduated and conducted my bachelor thesis at Porsche, writing about the service management of the digital production planning systems. At this time I was not aware of the DevOps movement and studied a lot about service management with ITIL.

#### Working Student [@Ratiodata](https://www.ratiodata.de/)

During my studies, I was working as a developer for Ratiodata's Scan2bank21 application - an Android-based multifunction device application, that leads to greater efficiency and cost savings for banks. My role was to lead the whole SDLC from requirements engineering, prototyping, automated testing, and even the training of new developers. I was building and later owning the release & certification process of the applications that was conducted by Ricoh.

Ricoh and Ratiodata partnered to develop sector-specific document management services for financial services institutions. This involved optimizing internal work and information processes within banks by digitizing documents and making them more easily accessible.

Technological challenges have been designing a lightweight yet efficient Java application for multiple specific hardware systems, including multiple display sizes and low computing power (similar to 1st Gen iPhone), that needed to be able to process and transform high loads of image data using vendor-specific operating system and libraries.
