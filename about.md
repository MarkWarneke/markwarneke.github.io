## About

My career started as an account manager apprenticeship at the age of just 16. During my university, I developed into a software engineer. And now, I am running my own business while working as a Consultant for Microsoft.

My values are having an open-mindset and treating others with respect. My approach is highly engaging, value-driven, and methodical. I enjoy working in a high-paced and autonomous environment that focuses on the outcome instead of doing it for the sake of activity.

### Volunteer

In 2020 I started to work as a volunteer teacher for the [ReDI-school](https://www.redi-school.org/). ReDI School teaches technology to break down barriers and connect the digital leaders of tomorrow. Specifically, I taught a Python introduction course to professional newcomers.

### Community

I enjoy collaborating, sharing, and contributing to the success of others - this is something I picked up working for Microsoft.

Public speaking is a way to challenge and humble myself. My debut as a conference speaker was in 2019. I was fortunate enough to talk about a Big Data Platform implementation we have been working on to Microsoft colleagues at the internal Microsoft Ready conference. Later that year, I was invited to speak at the [PowerShell conference EU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k33Nini-Dc8&list=PLAFABUrB0mNkbAhsdifsPK5XyBHnj_NSD&index=2&t=16s) about a test-driven development approach for Infrastructure as Code.

Some of the stuff I present during community events can be found on my website [here](/talks.html).

### Founding of [MMMint.ai](https://mmmint.ai)

In 2020 two close friends and I founded [MMMint.ai](https://mmmint.ai).

The name is an acronym of the founders first names. The `int` part is short for intelligence, which is a reference to our data-driven machine-learning solutions. MINT also stands for the German translation of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math).

The objective of the company is to provide technology solutions based on substantial scientific or engineering challenges. Our goal is to create research and development intensive software and to bring these data-driven solutions to small- and medium-sized businesses. We develop new products based on scientific discovery or meaningful engineering innovation, [see Deep tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_tech).

I value the learnings of starting a company and taking care of commitments the most. Starting from scratch allows me to see things from a different perspective.

### Consulting 

[@Microsoft](https://microsoft.com), I got the opportunity to engage on multiple large scale Big Data and Analytics Platform projects. The goal of these projects was to enable customers to leverage the cloud. We empowered our customers  to rapidly develop, release, and scale distributed applications.

These projects typically leveraged cloud-native, open-source solutions that run on Microsoft's Cloud Azure. I was responsible for the functional and technical analysis, the whole Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), including but not limited to application development, DevOps, and security.

I value a continuous-improvement mindset, which is why I engage in numerous inner source projects at Microsoft.  I am an active maintainer and top contributor to open- and inner-source projects, like the DevOps Dojo.
The DevOps Dojo started as an internal movement to make internal projects and software development implementation more efficient. The developed material is now offered as [a public learning experience on the Microsoft docs for free](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/devops-dojo-white-belt-foundation/).

During Microsoft, I engaged as a speaker and a trainer. Evangelizing and advocating about the latest trends at Meetups, hackathons, and conferences. Frequent topics included: Cloud-Native, Infrastructure as Code, and DevOps. I was fortunate to facilitate and host the [@PowerShell UserGroup in Munich](https://github.com/GPSUG) starting in 2017 right after joining Microsoft.

Microsoft allowed me to dig into the latest technologies. I was able to achieve numerous certifications. You can find my badges on [acclaim/mark-warneke](https://www.youracclaim.com/users/mark-warneke/badges).

### Self-employment

In 2019 I started to moonlight as a self-employed Software Engineer. My idea was to get some hands-on software development experience.

 [@Eve](https://starteve.ai) I got the opportunity to work on an accessibility product that recognizes speech to generates automated live captions. Eve augments humans. By proposing the transcript humans can review and correct the AI's suggestions. The idea is to enable and make conferences more accessible and inclusive by providing live captions and translation. Users can read the captions on large external monitors or even on their phones. Everything is configurable to the attendee's needs and preferences - from language settings to text size, and visual representation.

Eve allowed me to develop further as a software engineer, always pushing for the most innovative and suitable solutions. We adopted many cloud-native technologies. A micro-services architecture on Kubernetes, web-sockets, feature-flags, and a full continuous deployment experience.

The engagement at EVE taught me how to develop a product in a small team. And how to do it truly agile. How to innovate and how to bring features to end-users as quickly as possible - while keeping the services available and resilient.

During the self-employment I engaged on Microsoft 365 Administration work for SMB companies. I managed and operated Microsoft Teams, Exchange Online, as well as Azure Active Directory.

Futhermore I supported and conducted smaller Business Intelligence projects. The goal was to visualize KPI and create and design dashboards using SQL and PowerBI, leveraging the CRISP/DM process.

#### B.Sc. Business Informatics

During university [@the University of Applied Science Münster](https://en.fh-muenster.de), I fell in love with software engineering. I chose to specialize in Web & Software Engineering and I took courses in business intelligence, machine learning,  and artificial intelligence.

At the time I was always looking to apply my theoretical knowledge and since the second semester, I started working as a working student for different companies. [Vectron Systems](https://www.vectron-systems.com/) allowed me to apply my knowledge as a web developer and get my feet wet as a professional Software Engineer.

During my studies, I engaged as a consultant for the student consultancy [KREAKTIV Münster e.V.](https://kreaktiv-muenster.de/). Which allowed me to get some exposure to smaller IT projects. The club offered a variety of seminars including a six sigma certification which I gladly used.

I graduated and conducted my bachelor thesis [@Porsche](https://www.porsche.com/).
At Porsche, I wrote about the IT service management process of the digital production planning systems. At this time I focused on the classic change management processes described in ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library). The agile way of working and the DevOps movement was something I have not been exposed to and thus was not aware of. Looking back I value learning about ITIL - it gives me a different perspective on where companies are coming from and what mindset these companies might perceive.

#### Working Student

During my studies, I was lastly working as a software engineer for Ratiodata.

[@Ratiodata](https://www.ratiodata.de/) I was developing the Scan2bank21 application - an Android-based multifunction device application, that leads to greater efficiency and cost savings for banks.
My job included the whole SDLC from requirements engineering, prototyping, automated testing, and even the training of new developers.
At this time I learned about why version control matters, how to automate the building of artifacts (packaging JAR files with ANT), and releasing packaged software.

Ricoh and Ratiodata partnered to develop sector-specific document management services for financial services institutions. This involved optimizing internal work and information processes within banks by digitizing documents and overall making processes more efficient.

Technological challenges have been designing a lightweight yet efficient Java application. The software was designed and written for multiple specific hardware systems, including multiple form factor, display sizes and running with low computing power.
The application needed to process and transform image data using the vendor-specific operating systems and some open-source libraries.

### History

My career started as a Management Assistant apprentice [@ETe-Datentechnik](http://www.ete-datentechnik.com/) - a small company from my hometown specializing in network technology.

I became the only account manager for the company at the age of just 18. And my responsibility grew not only to be certified in the main technologies that the company offered, including Cisco, VMware and IBM, but also to drive existing and create new business.

My job included not only selling but to consult the customer in IT Hardware like Server & Storage solutions as well as corporate IT networking & Voice over IP telephony.

I was responsible for generating new businesses by conducting cold-calls and driving marketing initiatives. My greatest success at that time was landing a huge server & storage project with IBM from a cold-call. After this experience, I moved on to university. ETe taught me a lot about becoming a professional. I am very grateful for the experience.
